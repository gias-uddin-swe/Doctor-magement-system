                Pair large text with an image to give focus to your chosen
                product, collection, or blog post. Add details on availability,
                style, or even provide a review. Even if you can't afford to
                travel the world, you can take your children to the museum, zoo
                or local park. And don't be afraid to take them to grown-up
                spots. Eating out in a restaurant teaches children how to be
                quiet and polite and gives them the pleasure of knowing you
                trust them to behave.
